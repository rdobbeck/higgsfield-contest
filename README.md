## Kling Animation Prompts

### Shot 1: "The Repeat"
**File:** `shot-1-the-repeat-compressed.jpg`
```
Camera locked. Opponent in black tactical gear throws powerful straight punch from right toward fighter in white on left, punch extends forward in slow motion (240fps feel) with natural motion blur, punch stops just before contact. Fighter in white reacts with subtle defensive movement, eyes showing confusion and surprise. Smooth, realistic martial arts choreography. Motion intensity: Medium.
```

### Shot 2: "The Notice"
**File:** `shot-2-the-notice-compressed.jpg`
```
Camera locked, static extreme close-up. Eyes widen slowly as pupils dilate, eyebrows furrow in confusion and realization, subtle head tilt to the right. Brief reflection of movement flickers across iris surface. Micro-expressions showing confusion transitioning to understanding. Realistic eye movement with natural moisture and light reflection. Motion intensity: Low.
```

### Shot 3: "The Test"
**File:** `shot-3-the-test-compressed.jpg`
```
Camera locked, wide shot. Opponent in black gear on right side throws powerful spinning back kick toward protagonist on left, leg extends with motion blur in arc trajectory. Protagonist in white dodges backward and to the left with smooth martial arts evasion, balanced defensive stance. Both fighters maintain clean form, spatial separation remains consistent. Reflective floor shows subtle movement. Realistic martial arts choreography. Motion intensity: Medium-High.
```

### Shot 4: "The Counter"
**File:** `shot-4-the-counter-compressed.jpg`
```
Camera locked at 45-degree angle. Protagonist in white shirt delivers forward palm strike to opponent's chest, arm extends with force, hand makes contact. Opponent in black armor reacts to impact, body shifts backward slightly, torso compressed. Motion lines and slight motion blur on striking arm. Dramatic action moment captured at peak impact. Realistic martial arts physics. Motion intensity: High.
```

### Shot 5: "The Break"
**File:** `shot-5-the-break-compressed.jpg`
```
Camera locked. Opponent in black gear mid-air in attack pose FREEZES completely while protagonist in white steps backward with shocked expression, hands raising defensively. Frozen opponent remains suspended impossibly in air, no movement. Protagonist shows growing realization and confusion. Subtle blue lighting begins to tint the scene. Surreal physics-breaking moment. Motion intensity: Low (only protagonist moves).
```

### Shot 6: "The Reveal"
**File:** `shot-6-the-reveal-compressed.jpg`
```
Camera slow push-in (slight zoom). Protagonist in black VR suit and headset reaches up with both hands, grips headset, pulls upward removing it from head. Facial expression transitions from intense concentration to exhausted relief, breathing heavily. Background monitors display "AI TRAINING COMPLETE" text, blue LED lights glow. Cables and tracking equipment visible. Realistic VR removal motion. Motion intensity: Medium.
```
