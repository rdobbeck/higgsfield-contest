# High-Potential Concept Ideas

## Option A: "Last Stand"
**Length:** 60 seconds
**Genre:** Military/Thriller

### Logline:
A lone soldier with one bullet left must hold a doorway against overwhelming force to save the civilians behind him.

### Beat Sheet:
1. **Hook (0-3s):** Close-up of soldier checking revolver - one bullet left. Distant footsteps echo.
2. **Setup (3-15s):** Wide shot reveals he's blocking narrow doorway. Behind him: terrified civilians. Ahead: shadows approaching.
3. **Escalation (15-40s):** Hand-to-hand combat sequence. Uses environment, desperation tactics. Gets wounded.
4. **Climax (40-55s):** Final attacker. Aims. Fires one shot. Hit.
5. **Payoff (55-60s):** Door closes behind civilians escaping. He slides down, smiling. Mission complete.

### Why It Wins:
- **Emotion:** Sacrifice, heroism
- **Restraint:** Limited resources = tension
- **Clear stakes:** Civilians visible = we care
- **Rewatchable:** Clean action choreography

### Visual Style:
- Reference: *John Wick* hallway fight, *1917* trenches
- Color: Desaturated blues/grays
- Camera: Mostly locked, one continuous tracking shot for climax

## Option B: "Time Debt"
**Length:** 45 seconds
**Genre:** Sci-fi Action

### Logline:
A woman with super-speed powers races to reach her daughter's birthday party, knowing every second she uses costs years of her life.

### Beat Sheet:
1. **Hook (0-3s):** Woman's watch ticking backward in extreme slow-motion. Her eyes glow.
2. **Setup (3-10s):** Tight on her face aging slightly. She checks phone: "Emma's party - 2 blocks away, 30 seconds late"
3. **Escalation (10-35s):** HIGH-SPEED parkour through city. World frozen around her. Each obstacle = visual aging (hair graying, wrinkles).
4. **Climax (35-40s):** Reaches door. Hesitates. Pushes through.
5. **Payoff (40-45s):** Speed stops. She's aged 20 years. Daughter sees her, runs to hug. She smiles through tears. Worth it.

### Why It Wins:
- **Original concept:** Visual metaphor for sacrifice
- **Emotion:** Parental love

## Option C: "The Glitch"
**Length:** 30 seconds
**Genre:** Martial Arts/Sci-fi

### Logline:

### Beat Sheet:
1. **Hook (0-3s):** Punch comes at camera. FREEZE. Rewind slightly. Same punch again.
2. **Setup (3-8s):** Fighter dodges. Notices opponent's stance is identical to last round. Confusion.
3. **Escalation (8-20s):** Rapid combat. Fighter starts predicting every move. Opponent = robot-like repetition.
4. **Climax (20-27s):** Fighter delivers perfect counter combo. Opponent freezes mid-air. World glitches.
5. **Payoff (27-30s):** Pulls back to reveal: fighter is in VR rig. Screen reads "AI Training Complete - Model Accuracy 99.8%"

### Why It Wins:
- **Mind-bending:** Twist ending
- **Tight:** 30 seconds = high rewatch value
- **Relevant:** AI training theme
- **Clever:** Works on multiple levels

### Visual Style:

## Option D: "Extraction: 60 Seconds"
**Length:** 60 seconds
**Genre:** Heist/Action

### Logline:
A thief has 60 seconds to steal a diamond and escape before the room reseals—but the security system is adaptive.

2. **Setup (3-10s):** Grabs diamond. Alarms. Doors start closing. Timer: 50 seconds.
3. **Escalation (10-45s):** Parkour through closing corridors. Lasers appear. Floor tiles drop. Each obstacle adapts to her moves.
4. **Climax (45-55s):** Final door closing. Slides under. Timer: 3... 2...
5. **Payoff (55-60s):** Makes it. Breathes. Looks at "diamond"—it's a flash drive. Smirks. Real heist was data.

### Why It Wins:
- **Real-time tension:** Countdown = built-in pacing
- **Escalation:** Each obstacle harder
- **Twist:** Subverts expectation
- **Clean concept:** Easy to follow

### Visual Style:

2. **Setup (3-12s):** Musician realizes their power. Experiments. Objects levitate with chords.
3. **Escalation (12-35s):** Villains attack. Uses guitar as weapon. Each note = different effect (push, shield, slice).
4. **Climax (35-42s):** Charges final "chord." Reality warps. Plays perfectly. Shockwave.
5. **Payoff (42-45s):** Enemies defeated. City safe. Looks at guitar. "I should get lessons."
