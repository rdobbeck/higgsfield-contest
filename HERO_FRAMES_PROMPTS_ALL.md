```

### Alternative - Less VFX Heavy (Add glitch in post):

```
dramatic moment of opponent frozen mid-air in attack pose, black tactical fighter suspended impossibly in white minimalist dojo, Asian protagonist in white gear stepping backward in shock and realization, hands raised defensively, surreal sci-fi atmosphere, volumetric lighting with subtle blue accent lighting beginning to appear, cinematic suspension of physics, shot on ARRI Alexa with anamorphic lens for epic feel, professional color grade transitioning from cool white to cyan blue --ar 9:16 --style raw --v 6.1 --q 2
```

### Critical Elements:
- ✅ Opponent frozen/suspended
- ✅ Protagonist shocked reaction
- ✅ Beginning of environment transformation
- ✅ This is the MONEY SHOT - make it epic
- ✅ Blue/cyan glitch elements (can add more in post)

**Note:** Generate both versions. The "less VFX" version might be easier for Midjourney and you add heavy glitch in DaVinci Resolve.

## GENERATION ORDER & STRATEGY

### Day 1 Morning - Generate in This Order:

1. **Shot 2 (Eyes)** - Simplest, tests if Midjourney can match the face
2. **Shot 6 (Lab)** - Different environment, can work independently
3. **Shot 3 (Wide Dodge)** - Most similar to Shot 1, should be easy
4. **Shot 4 (Impact)** - Medium difficulty
5. **Shot 5 (Glitch)** - Hardest, most VFX

### For Each Shot:

1. Copy prompt to Midjourney
2. Generate 4 variations
3. Pick best match for:
   - Character consistency (face, outfit)
   - Environment consistency (white dojo aesthetic)
   - Composition (works for animation)
   - Clean execution (no weird artifacts)
4. Upscale winner
5. Save to `/Users/uni/higgsfield-contest/hero-frames/shot-[number]-[name].jpeg`

## CHARACTER CONSISTENCY TIPS

If Midjourney changes the protagonist's face too much:

### Solution 1: Use Shot 1 as reference image
- Upload `shot-1-the-repeat.jpeg` to Midjourney
- Add `--cref [URL]` parameter
- This tells Midjourney to keep character consistent

### Solution 2: Describe face more specifically
Add to prompts:
```
same Asian male fighter from previous shot, short dark hair, strong jawline, athletic build age 28-32
```

### Solution 3: Use Character Reference Weight
```
--cref [Shot 1 URL] --cw 75
```
(Character weight 0-100, higher = more similar)

---

## BACKUP PLAN

If Midjourney struggles with consistency across shots:

**Option A:** Embrace slight variation
- Story is about AI training, so slight inconsistency can be explained
- Focus on outfit/environment consistency over perfect face match

**Option B:** Regenerate with tighter controls
- Use character reference images
- Describe face in extreme detail
- Generate 10+ variations, pick closest matches

**Option C:** Edit in post
- Use face swap AI tools (Midjourney's face swap, InsightFace)
- Subtle color correction to match

---

## READY TO START?

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Start with Shot 2 (Eyes)** - quick test of face consistency
2. If face matches well → proceed with all shots
3. If face doesn't match → add character reference to remaining prompts

Generate **Shot 2 first** and show me the results. We'll adjust strategy based on how well Midjourney maintains the protagonist's appearance.

**Copy this prompt and paste into Midjourney:**

```
extreme close-up macro shot of Asian male's eyes, intense focused expression, dark brown eyes widening in realization moment, dilated pupils, eyebrows slightly furrowed in confusion and understanding, dramatic side lighting creating depth, reflection of movement visible in iris, shallow depth of field f/1.4, blurred white minimalist background, hyper-realistic skin texture and detail, shot on ARRI Alexa with Zeiss Macro 100mm lens, professional color grading with cool desaturated cyan tones, cinematic film still, 8K detail --ar 9:16 --style raw --v 6.1 --q 2
```

Want me to also create a quick reference sheet with all 6 prompts in one file for easy copy-paste?
