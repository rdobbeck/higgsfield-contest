# Production Workflow

## Phase 1: Pre-Production (TODAY - 2 hours)

### Step 1: Concept Selection (15 min)
- [ ] Review concept ideas
- [ ] Pick genre that excites you
- [ ] Verify no copyrighted elements needed

### Step 2: Script Writing (30 min)

**Format:**
```
TITLE: [Punchy name]
LENGTH: [30-90 seconds target]
LOGLINE: [One sentence pitch]

BEAT SHEET:
1. Hook (0-3s): [What stops the scroll?]
2. Setup (3-15s): [Who? What do they want?]
3. Escalation (15-40s): [Action intensifies]
4. Climax (40-55s): [Peak moment]
5. Payoff (55-60s): [Emotional landing]

VISUAL STYLE: [Reference films/videos]
MUSIC/SOUND: [Mood description]
```

### Step 3: Shot List (45 min)

**Template for each shot:**
```
SHOT #: [Number]
DURATION: [Seconds]
TYPE: [Wide/Medium/Close-up/POV/Tracking/etc.]
DESCRIPTION: [What happens]
AI PROMPT: [Specific generation prompt]
REFERENCE: [Link to visual reference]
PRIORITY: [Critical/Important/Nice-to-have]
```

**Target:** 6-10 shots maximum for 60 seconds

**Shot Types to Include:**
- 2-3 wide establishing shots (context, scale)
- 2-3 medium action shots (main sequence)
- 1-2 close-ups (emotion, detail)
- 1 "money shot" (hero moment - your thumbnail)

### Step 4: Asset Gathering (30 min)
- [ ] Collect reference images
- [ ] Download Higgsfield watermark
- [ ] Scout royalty-free music options
- [ ] Download sound effects library

## Phase 2: Production (Days 1-3)

### AI Generation Strategy

**Tools Recommended:**
- **Kling AI:** Best for camera movement, continuous shots
- **Runway Gen-3:** Best for character consistency
- **Pika:** Best for effects, transformations
- **Midjourney/Flux:** Create hero frames first, then animate

### Generation Workflow per Shot:

1. **Create hero frame** (still image)
   - Use Midjourney/Flux for highest quality
   - Iterate until perfect
   - This becomes your keyframe

2. **Generate variations** (3-5 per shot)
   - Use hero frame as reference
   - Slightly different prompts/seeds
   - Always generate multiples

3. **Select best take**
   - Criteria: consistency, movement quality, no artifacts
   - Don't settle for "good enough"
   - Re-generate if needed

4. **Upscale/enhance**
   - Target 1080p minimum (4K preferred)
   - Use Topaz Video AI or similar for enhancement

### Daily Targets:

**Day 1:** Generate shots 1-3 (setup/hook)
**Day 2:** Generate shots 4-7 (action/escalation)
**Day 3:** Generate shots 8-10 (climax/payoff) + backups

### Live-Action Integration (Optional):

If you have access to:
- Clean location
- Camera (phone is fine)
- Basic lighting

Consider shooting:
- Character close-ups (easier to control)
- Hand detail shots
- Environment plates to composite into

**Ratio:** 30% live-action + 70% AI = more believable

## Phase 3: Post-Production (Day 4)

### Editing Software Options:
- **DaVinci Resolve** (free, professional)
- **Premiere Pro** (industry standard)
- **CapCut** (free, easy, mobile-friendly)
- **Final Cut Pro** (Mac only)

### Editing Workflow:

1. **Assembly (1 hour)**
   - Drop all selected shots in timeline
   - Rough cut to pacing
   - Verify total length (30-90s target)

2. **Timing refinement (1 hour)**
   - Cut on action (hide transitions)
   - Vary shot length (visual rhythm)
   - Remove any dead moments
   - First 3 seconds = critical (re-edit until perfect)

3. **Color grading (1 hour)**
   - Match shots for consistency
   - Apply cinematic LUT
   - Enhance mood/tone
   - Reference: upload reference film frame, match colors

4. **Sound design (2 hours)**
   - **Music:** Royalty-free only
     - Epidemic Sound (paid)
     - Artlist (paid)

     - Freesound.org
     - Zapsplat
     - BBC Sound Effects Archive
   - **Mix:** Music at -12db, SFX at -6db, dialogue at 0db
   - Use strategic silence for impact

5. **VFX touches (1 hour)**
   - Speed ramping (slow-mo at key moments)
   - Screen shake on impacts
   - Motion blur for fast movement
   - Particle effects if needed

6. **Final polish (30 min)**
   - Add Higgsfield watermark (required)
   - Add subtle vignette
   - Check pacing one more time
   - Export multiple versions (see below)

### Export Settings:
