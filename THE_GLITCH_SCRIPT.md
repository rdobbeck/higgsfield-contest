# "THE GLITCH" - Full Script

**Title:** THE GLITCH
**Runtime:** 30 seconds
**Genre:** Martial Arts / Sci-Fi

---

## LOGLINE

A martial artist realizes their sparring opponent is repeating the same moves—because they're unknowingly training an AI combat system.

---

## THEME

The line between reality and simulation. What we think is real practice is actually data collection.

---

---

## SHOT-BY-SHOT BREAKDOWN

### SHOT 1: "THE REPEAT" (0-4 seconds)
**Type:** Medium shot, locked camera
**Action:**
- Opponent (dressed in black tactical gear, face obscured) throws a right hook
- Camera FREEZES mid-punch
- REWINDS 0.5 seconds (subtle video glitch effect)
- Same punch comes again, EXACT same trajectory

**Visual:**
- Clean white dojo environment
- Minimalist (think Apple Store meets martial arts gym)
- Protagonist (athletic build, white training gear) in defensive stance, looking confused

**Audio:**
- Punch whoosh
- GLITCH sound (digital artifact)
- Tension drone (low frequency)

**Text Overlay (optional):** None

**Why this shot:**
- IMMEDIATE hook - something is wrong
- Visual glitch = scroll-stopping moment
- Sets up the mystery in 4 seconds

---

### SHOT 2: "THE NOTICE" (4-8 seconds)
**Type:** Close-up on protagonist's eyes
**Action:**
- Protagonist's eyes widen slightly
- Pupils dilate (subtle)
- Eyes dart left-right (tracking opponent's predictable movement)
- Expression shifts from confusion → understanding

**Visual:**
- Tight on eyes, slight bokeh background
- Opponent's movement reflected in eyes
- Color grade: cooler tones (blue/cyan)

**Audio:**
- Heartbeat (single thump)
- Breathing (controlled)
- Distant echo of opponent's footsteps (repeating pattern)

**Text Overlay (optional):** None

**Why this shot:**
- Emotional connection - we're IN the protagonist's head
- Builds tension without words
- Close-up = high impact on small screens

---

### SHOT 3: "THE TEST" (8-15 seconds)
**Type:** Wide shot, slight slow-motion
**Action:**
- Opponent attacks with same 3-move combo:
  1. Right hook
  2. Left uppercut
  3. Spinning back kick
- Protagonist dodges all three PERFECTLY (not even close)
- Camera captures full bodies, emphasizing protagonist's perfect positioning

**Visual:**
- White dojo, clean lines
- Motion blur on opponent
- Protagonist = crystal clear (they're in control)
- Lighting: opponent slightly darker, protagonist lit

**Audio:**
- Whoosh x3 (opponent's attacks)
- Silence (protagonist's dodges - no contact)
- Music builds (ominous synth)

**Text Overlay (optional):** None

**Why this shot:**
- This is the ACTION beat
- Demonstrates protagonist's advantage
- Wide shot shows choreography clearly

---

### SHOT 4: "THE COUNTER" (15-20 seconds)
**Type:** Dynamic tracking shot (POV-style)
**Action:**
- Protagonist launches counter-attack
- Rapid combo: palm strike → knee → sweep
- Each hit connects PERFECTLY
- Final sweep: opponent freezes mid-fall

**Visual:**
- Camera follows protagonist's movement (handheld feel)
- Impact frames (1-2 frame freeze on each hit)
- Opponent starts GLITCHING on final hit (digital artifacts appear)

**Audio:**
- Impact sounds x3 (meaty hits)
- GLITCH intensifies on final hit
- Music drops out

**Text Overlay (optional):** None

**Why this shot:**
- Payoff for protagonist's understanding
- Most "action movie" moment
- Glitch effect foreshadows reveal

---

### SHOT 5: "THE BREAK" (20-25 seconds)
**Type:** Medium shot, camera locked
**Action:**
- Opponent frozen mid-air (from sweep)
- Digital glitches spread across their body
- Entire dojo environment starts GLITCHING
  - Walls flicker
  - Floor grid pattern appears
  - Lighting strobes (digital artifacts)
- Protagonist steps back, looks around in shock

**Visual:**
- Heavy VFX: scan lines, digital noise, polygonal artifacts
- Color shift: white dojo → blue digital grid
- Opponent dissolves into wireframe/particles

**Audio:**
- MASSIVE glitch sound (bass drop)
- Digital decay/corruption sounds
- Silence underneath (eerie)

**Text Overlay (optional):** None

**Why this shot:**
- Visual spectacle moment (money shot for thumbnail)
- Reality breaks = "whoa" moment
- Transitions to reveal

---

### SHOT 6: "THE REVEAL" (25-30 seconds)
**Type:** Wide pullback shot
**Action:**
- Camera PULLS BACK rapidly
- Reveal: protagonist is in VR motion capture rig
  - Wearing haptic suit
  - VR headset
  - Standing in small tracking space
- Screen next to them displays:
  ```
  AI TRAINING COMPLETE
  COMBAT MODEL v3.7
  ACCURACY: 99.8%
  DATASET: 10,000 SPARRING SESSIONS
  ```
- Protagonist removes headset, breathes heavily, looks at screen
- Slight smile (proud? disturbed? ambiguous)

**Visual:**
- Realistic lab/tech environment (contrast to dojo)
- Blue LED lighting, screens, cables
- Protagonist = sweaty, exhausted (real physical effort)
- Color: warm (returning to reality)

**Audio:**
- Ambient lab sounds (computers humming, fans)
- Protagonist's heavy breathing
- Single piano note (contemplative)
- Music fades out

**Text Overlay:**
- On screen display (readable): "AI TRAINING COMPLETE - 99.8%"

**Why this shot:**
- Mind-bending reveal
- Recontextualizes ENTIRE video
- Makes people want to rewatch immediately
- Ambiguous ending (is this good? scary?) = discussion in comments

## DIALOGUE

**NONE.**

This is a purely visual story. Dialogue would slow it down and reduce international appeal.

## VISUAL EFFECTS BREAKDOWN

### VFX Needed:

1. **Rewind effect (Shot 1):**
   - Time remap in editing software
   - Add subtle RGB split during rewind

2. **Glitch effects (Shots 4-5):**
   - Digital noise overlay
   - Scan lines
   - Pixelation/datamoshing
   - RGB channel separation
   - Wireframe dissolve

3. **Environment transition (Shot 5):**
   - Grid floor overlay
   - Particle system (opponent dissolving)

4. **Screen graphics (Shot 6):**
   - Animated terminal text
   - Slight screen flicker/CRT effect

**Tools:**
- After Effects (if experienced)
- DaVinci Resolve Fusion (free)
- CapCut glitch presets (easiest)

---

## CASTING/CHARACTER DESIGN

### PROTAGONIST:
- **Age:** 25-35
- **Build:** Athletic, lean (martial artist physique)
- **Outfit:** White training gi or tactical athletic wear
- **Expression:** Focused → Confused → Understanding → Shocked → Contemplative
- **Race/Gender:** Your choice (universal story)

### OPPONENT:
- **Age:** Irrelevant (it's AI/simulation)
- **Build:** Similar to protagonist
- **Outfit:** Black tactical gear, face obscured (helmet/mask)
- **Movement:** Robotic, precise, repetitive (intentionally unnatural)

---

## THEME & SUBTEXT

### Surface Level:
Cool martial arts twist ending

### Deeper Layer:
- We're training AI to replace us
- The "practice" we think makes us better is actually teaching machines
- Ambiguous ending: Is protagonist proud of creating something powerful? Or disturbed they're obsolete?

### Discussion Bait:
- Comments will debate: "Is this a good or bad future?"
- "Who's really in control here?"
- "Black Mirror vibes"

---

## REWATCH VALUE

### First Watch:
- Cool action scene with weird glitch

### Second Watch:
- Notice opponent's movements ARE repetitive from start
- Protagonist's reactions make sense now
- Every detail has meaning

### Easter Eggs (optional):
- Subtle "v3.7" label on opponent's gear (foreshadowing)
- Binary code in background (translates to "SIMULATION")
- Protagonist's wristband is a fitness tracker = data collection
